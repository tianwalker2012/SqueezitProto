//What's my expectation to this class?
//I expect it as a independent timeCounter.
//I can insert it to the place.
//Setup remaining second, it will start tick,
//Will callback once the time is up.
//And turn himself off after the time is up.
//Basic mechanism will be like this:
//Every time I wake up by the timer will check the different 
//Between last weak up and this weak up and minus the difference from the remain time. 
//If the remain become zero or minus will stop the NSTimer and call teh timeUpOps.
