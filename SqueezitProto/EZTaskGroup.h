// The purpose of this class, it just help people to organize their tasks.
// Previously I am thinking about use the TaskList to carry the Environment traits.
// This just a restriction. Why prevent people from lump any task into one list as long as 
// It make sense to them. 
// To somebody it mean freedom, while to other people it means choas and messy.
// They don't know how to organize things, they need restriction as guidance. 
// Appearantly, this type not my target audience.
// The value is hibernate provided a good API which could save people's time and energy to understand 
// Persistence layer.
